You can replace the audio contents of mpcountdownend.wav with whatever you'd like, note that the file provided with the mod zip has 1 second of silence at the beginning.
This is because the sound actually starts playing when the lobby countdown reaches 1, not when it says 'starting...', so you need to delay it by 1 second for things to sound right and not overlap.
I couldn't figure out a good way to achieve this delay in code, but adding 1 second of padding to the beginning of an audio file is easy so whatever. I recommend using Audacity's "Generate Silence" tool to do this.

The only thing needed for your own replacement sound to work is for the filename to remain as 'mpcountdownend.wav' and for it to actually be a wav file.
This is required because the codemod loads mpcountdownend.wav into an AudioClip by finding an audio file of type WAV at the location specified by BallisticNG\User\Mods\Code Mods\VanillaPlus\Audio\mpcountdownend.wav

If you want to change the 3 preceding beeps/sounds for the lobby countdown, you can do so through a regular soundpack.
Find a sound you like, convert it to .wav if it's not already in that format, and place it in BallisticNG\User\Mods\Sounds\YourSoundpackName with the filename 'mpcountdown.wav', and enable the soundpack in the in-game settings menus.
